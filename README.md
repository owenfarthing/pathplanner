# pathplanner
Code for a pathplanning project I coded at UF; the API was developed by Jeremiah Blanchard.

Simply put, this code works with a preexisting API to initialize a path search over a hexogonal tilemap.
The API was written by Jeremiah Blanchard for a class project at UF.
Function signatures were provided for some aspects of the API as seen in my code.
The code was tested on various map sizes and optimized to adhere to performance benchmarks.
The path search is implemented using A* and is controlled by a simple GUI.
The drawn path is graphically displayed for the user to observe.
The entirety of this project is written in C++.
